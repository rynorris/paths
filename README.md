paths
-----

*paths* is a software path-tracing renderer written in Rust.

It is purely a hobby-project for me to learn about this technology, and I had no idea how path-tracing worked (other than vague intuition) before starting.

### Implementation Checklist

- [x] Basic path tracing of spheres
- [ ] Point lights
- [ ] Multithreading
- [ ] Support 3d models (triangle meshes)
- [ ] Adaptive sampling
- [ ] Importance sampling
- [ ] Reflective materials
- [ ] Translucent materials (refraction)
- [ ] Bi-directional path tracing
- [ ] Consider direct paths to light sources

### Examples

2 Spheres with large off-screen light source
